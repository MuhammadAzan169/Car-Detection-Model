# Car-Detection-Model
After learning More about Machine and  Deep Learning made this project for practice
Our cutting-edge model is designed to enhance highway safety through advanced vehicle detection. Leveraging the power of a Haar Cascade Classifier, it efficiently identifies and marks each car within a designated highway segment. The model skillfully employs rectangular bounding boxes to highlight the presence of vehicles, providing a robust solution for monitoring and managing traffic on the road.
